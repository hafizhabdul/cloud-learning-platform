# Authentication Test Results

## Test Environment
- Backend: http://localhost:8080 ✅ Running
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173 ✅ Running

## Manual Test Cases

### 1. Registration Flow
**Steps:**
1. Open http://localhost:5173 
2. Should redirect to /auth (authentication page)
3. Click "Register here" to switch to registration form
4. Fill in the registration form:
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: password123
   - Confirm Password: password123
5. Click "Register" button

**Expected Result:**
- User should be registered successfully
- User should be automatically logged in
- Should redirect to the main dashboard

### 2. Login Flow
**Steps:**
1. If already logged in, logout first (click user avatar → logout)
2. Should redirect to /auth
3. Fill in login form:
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: password123
4. Click "Login" button

**Expected Result:**
- User should be logged in successfully
- Should redirect to the main dashboard
- User info should appear in the header

### 3. Protected Routes
**Steps:**
1. Try to access any route while not logged in (e.g., http://localhost:5173/dashboard)

**Expected Result:**
- Should redirect to /auth automatically

### 4. Logout Flow
**Steps:**
1. While logged in, click the user avatar in the header
2. Click "Logout" from the dropdown menu

**Expected Result:**
- User should be logged out
- Should redirect to /auth
- All protected routes should be inaccessible

```

### Register User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

### Login User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \

  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
