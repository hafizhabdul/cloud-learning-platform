## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive learning platform for Cloud Solutions Architects, supporting multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) with interactive tutorials, practice labs, assessments, and progress tracking.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with modern UI components
